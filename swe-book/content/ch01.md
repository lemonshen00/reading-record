# What Is Software Engineering?
> Nothing is built on stone; all is built on sand, but we must build as if the sand were stone. ----Jorge Luis Borges

We see three critical differences between programming and software engineering: time, `scale`, and the `trade-offs` at play.`On` a software engineering project, engineers need to `be more concerned with` the `passage of time` and the eventual need for change. `In` a software engineering organization, we need to `be more concerned about` scale and `efficiency`, both for the software we produce as well as for the organization that is producing it. Finally, as software engineers, we are asked to make more complex decisions with `higher-stakes outcomes`, often based on `imprecise(precise:精准的) estimates` of time and growth.

`Within` Google, we sometimes say, `Software engineering is programming integrated over time.` Programming is certainly a `significant` part of software engineering: after all, programming is how you generate new software `in the first place`. If you accept this `distinction`, it also becomes clear that we might need to `delineate` between programming tasks (development) and software engineering tasks (development, `modification`, `maintenance`). The addition of time adds an important new `dimension` to programming. `Cubes` aren’t `squares`, distance isn’t `velocity`. Software engineering isn’t programming.

One way to see the `impact` of time on a program is to think about the question, “What is the expected life span of your code?” Reasonable answers `to` this question vary by roughly a factor of 100,000. It is just as reasonable to think of code that needs to last for a few minutes as it is to imagine code that will `live for decades`. Generally, code `on the short end of that spectrum` is unaffected by time. It is `unlikely` that you need to adapt to a new version of your `underlying libraries`, operating system (OS), hardware, or language version for a program whose `utility` `spans` only an hour. These `short-lived` systems are effectively “just” a programming problem, `in the same way` that `a cube compressed far enough in one dimension is a square`. As we expand that time to allow for longer life spans, change becomes more important. `Over a span of` a decade or more, most program dependencies, whether `implicit` or `explicit`, will likely change. This `recognition` is at the root of our distinction between software engineering and programming.

This distinction is at the core of what we call `sustainability` for software. Your project is `sustainable` if, for the expected life span of your software, `you are capable of` reacting to whatever valuable change `comes along`, for either technical or business reasons.  Importantly, we are looking only for capability—you might choose not to `perform a given upgrade`, either for `lack of value` or other `priorities`. When you are `fundamentally` `incapable of` reacting to a change in underlying technology or product direction, you’re placing a high-risk bet on the hope that such a change never becomes critical. For short-term projects, that might be a safe `bet`. Over `multiple` decades, it probably isn’t.

Another way to look at software engineering is to consider scale.  How many people are involved? What part do they play in the development and maintenance over time? A programming task is often an act of `individual creation`, but a software engineering task is a team effort. An early attempt to define software engineering produced a good definition for this viewpoint: `The multiperson development of multiversion programs.` This suggests the difference between software engineering and programming is one of both time and people. `Team collaboration` presents new problems, but also provides more `potential` to produce valuable systems than any single programmer could.

Team organization, project `composition`, and the policies and practices of a software project all `dominate` this `aspect` of software engineering `complexity`. These problems are `inherent` to scale: as the organization grows and its projects expand, does it become more efficient at producing software? Does our development workflow become more efficient as we grow, or do our `version control policies` and testing `strategies` cost us proportionally more? Scale issues around communication and human scaling have been discussed since the early days of software engineering, going all the way back to the Mythical Man Month Such scale issues are often matters of policy and are fundamental to the question of software sustainability: how much will it cost to do the things that we need to do repeatedly? 

We can also say that software engineering is different from programming `in terms of` the complexity of decisions that need to be made and their `stakes`. In software engineering, we are regularly forced to `evaluate` the trade-offs between several paths forward, sometimes with high stakes and often with `imperfect` value metrics. The job of a software engineer, or a software engineering leader, is to aim for sustainability and management of the scaling costs for the organization, the product, and the development workflow. With those inputs in mind, `evaluate` your trade-offs and make `rational` decisions. We might sometimes `defer maintenance changes`, or even `embrace` policies that don’t scale well, with the knowledge that we’ll need to revisit those decisions. Those choices should be `explicit` and clear about the deferred costs.

Rarely is there a `one-size-fits-all(翻译：一刀切，绝了)` solution in software engineering, and the same `applies to` this book. Given a factor of 100,000 for reasonable answers on “How long will this software live,” a range of perhaps a factor of 10,000 for “How many engineers are in your organization,” and who-knows-how-much for “How many compute resources are available for your project,” Google’s experience will probably not match yours. In this book, we aim to present what we’ve found that works for us in the construction and maintenance of software that we expect to last for decades, with tens of thousands of engineers, and world-spanning compute resources. Most of the practices that we find are necessary at that scale will also work well for `smaller endeavors`: consider this a report on one engineering ecosystem that we think could be good as you `scale up`. In a few places, `super-large scale` comes with its own costs, and we’d be happier to `not be paying extra overhead`. We call those out as a warning. Hopefully if your organization grows large enough to be worried about those costs, you can find a better answer.

Before we get to `specifics` about teamwork, culture, policies, and tools, let’s first elaborate on these primary themes of time, scale, and trade-offs.

## Time and Change
When a `novice` is learning to program, the life span of the resulting code is usually measured in hours or days. Programming `assignments` and exercises tend to be write-once, with little to no `refactoring` and certainly no long-term maintenance. These programs are often not rebuilt or `executed` ever again after their `initial` production. This isn’t surprising in a `pedagogical` setting. Perhaps in secondary or post-secondary education, we may find a team project course or hands-on `thesis`. If so, such projects are likely the only time student code will live longer than a month or so. Those developers might need to `refactor some code`, perhaps as a response to changing requirements(需求变了), but it is unlikely they are being asked to deal with `broader` changes to their environment.

We also find developers of short-lived code in common industry settings. `Mobile apps` often have a `fairly` short life span(Nothing is Certain Except Death, Taxes and a Short Mobile App Lifespan), and for better or worse, full rewrites are `relatively` common. Engineers at an early-stage startup might rightly choose to focus on immediate goals over long-term investments: the company might not live long enough to `reap the benefits` of an `infrastructure` investment that pays off slowly. A serial startup developer could very reasonably have 10 years of development experience and little or no experience `maintaining` any piece of software expected to exist for longer than a year or two.

On the other end of the spectrum, some successful projects have an effectively `unbounded` life span: we can’t reasonably `predict` an endpoint for Google Search, the Linux kernel, or the Apache HTTP Server project.  For most Google projects, we must `assume` that they will live `indefinitely`—we cannot predict when we won’t need to upgrade our dependencies, language versions, and so on. As their lifetimes grow, these long-lived projects eventually have a different feel to them than programming assignments or startup development.

Consider Figure 1-1, which `demonstrates` two software projects `on opposite ends` of this “expected life span” spectrum.  For a programmer working on a task with an expected life span of hours, what types of maintenance are reasonable to expect? That is, if a new version of your OS comes out while you’re working on a Python script that will be `executed` one time, should you drop what you’re doing and upgrade? Of course not: the upgrade is not critical. But on the opposite end of the spectrum, Google Search being `stuck` on a version of our OS from the 1990s would be a clear problem.

The low and high points on the expected life span spectrum suggest that there’s a `transition` somewhere. Somewhere along the line between a `one-off program` and a project that lasts for decades, a transition happens: a project must begin to `react to` changing externalities. For any project that didn’t plan for upgrades from the start, that `transition` is likely very painful for three reasons, each of which `compounds` the others:

- You’re performing a task that hasn’t yet been done for this project; more `hidden assumptions` have been baked-in.
- The engineers trying to do the upgrade are less likely to have experience in this sort of task.
- The size of the upgrade is often larger than usual, doing several years’ worth of upgrades at once `instead of` a more `incremental` upgrade.

And thus, after actually going through such an upgrade once (or `giving up part way through`), it’s pretty reasonable to `overestimate` the cost of doing a subsequent upgrade and decide “Never again.” Companies that come to this conclusion end up committing to just throwing things out and rewriting their code, or deciding to never upgrade again. Rather than take the natural approach by avoiding a painful task, sometimes the more responsible answer is to invest in making it less painful. It all depends on the cost of your upgrade, the value it provides, and the expected life span of the project in question.

Getting through not only that first big upgrade, but getting to the point at which you can `reliably` stay current `going forward`, is the `essence` of long-term sustainability for your project. Sustainability requires planning and managing the impact of required change. For many projects at Google, we believe we have achieved this sort of sustainability, `largely through trial and error`.

So, concretely, how does short-term programming differ from producing code with a much longer expected life span? Over time, we need to be much more aware of the difference between “happens to work” and “is maintainable.” There is no perfect solution for identifying these issues. That is unfortunate, because keeping software maintainable for the long-term is a `constant` `battle`.

Hyrum’s Law

If you are maintaining a project that is used by other engineers, the most important lesson about “it works” versus “it is maintainable” is what we’ve come to call Hyrum’s Law:

> With a `sufficient` number of users of an API, it does not matter what you promise in the contract: all `observable` behaviors of your system will be depended on by somebody.

In our experience, this `axiom` is a `dominant factor` in any discussion of changing software over time. It is conceptually akin to entropy: discussions of change and maintenance over time must be aware of Hyrum’s Law just as discussions of efficiency or thermodynamics must be mindful of entropy. Just because entropy never `decreases`(increase 增长) doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try to be efficient. Just because Hyrum’s Law will apply when maintaining software doesn’t mean we can’t plan for it or try to better understand it. We can `mitigate` it, but we know that it can never be `eradicated`.
